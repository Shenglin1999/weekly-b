        <p class="para-main">In this week's study, we learned a new skill, css. This is a program that can add various styles to our website.</p>

        <p class="para-1"> It allows us to achieve designs that html cannot. For example, more convenient typesetting and font color changes. It is possible to use different fonts on our website. You can change the font size in text more freely. Let our website add more possibilities and creativity. It also allows us to achieve more fun. I'm looking forward to learning more skills in the future, such as adding animation effects when jumping pages and sliding down web pages. </p>

        <p id="para-second">This week, my partner and I are almost done with the preliminary work on our business. If everything goes well, we may be able to successfully start our trial operation within this month. Although I havenâ€™t found the time to complete the design of our logo yet. We are going to name our business BeeCoo. Although it sounds quite ordinary, we have racked our brains to come up with the name. We selected about 15 styles of bracelets and necklaces and planned to sell them in the school. If we get a good start, maybe we will also try to open an online store like an Amazon store. At 10 o'clock in the evening on Thursday, I ended my course for the day, and I was pleasantly surprised to find an outdoor movie playing on the lawn of Oval. This is new to me. I felt lucky that night. But something small happened this weekend, which made me feel very depressed. hope everything is fine. </p>
